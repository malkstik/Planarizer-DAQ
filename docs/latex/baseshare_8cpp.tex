\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Source code of a base class for type-\/safe, thread-\/safe task data exchange classes. 

This file contains a base class for classes which exchange data between tasks. Inter-\/task data must be exchanged in a thread-\/safe manner, so the classes which share the data use mutexes or mutual exclusion mechanisms to prevent corruption of data. A linked list of all inter-\/task data items is kept by the system, and this base class contains members that handle that linked list.

Start the printout showing the status of all shared data items. 

This method begins printing out the status of all items in the system\textquotesingle{}s linked list of shared data items (queues, task shares, and so on). The most recently created share\textquotesingle{}s status is printed first, followed by the status of other shares in reverse order of creation.
