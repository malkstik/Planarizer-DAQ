\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a class which allows timer/counters on an STM32 to be used to read quadrature encoders within the Arduino environment. This code is a bit kludgey, as it was put together quickly in response to a fairly urgent need, but it has been tested and seems to work. It comes with no guarantees; YMMV. Valuable assistance was found at {\ttfamily \href{https://www.edwinfairchild.com/2019/04/interface-rotary-encoder-right-way.html}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+edwinfairchild.\+com/2019/04/interface-\/rotary-\/encoder-\/right-\/way.\+html}}} 

This file has been modified from code by JR Ridgeley for our purposes. Original code is at {\ttfamily \href{https://github.com/spluttflob/ME507-Support/blob/master/examples/encoder_counter.cpp}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/spluttflob/\+ME507-\/\+Support/blob/master/examples/encoder\+\_\+counter.\+cpp}}}
